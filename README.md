# Arbaaz Ali — Data Scientist & AI Engineer
**MSc Data Science & AI (Double Degree)** | EIT Manufacturing Scholar • Paris, France / Trento, Italy 


I build production-grade AI systems and data pipelines for industrial and web-scale problems. Practical focus: LLM-based extraction & RAG, MLOps for anomaly & risk detection, scalable backends, and data engineering.

---

## Core strengths
- Production MLOps: model inference, RAG, monitoring, CI/CD, deployments  
- Backend & data engineering: Python, Django/FastAPI, PostgreSQL, ETL, indexing & query tuning  
- ML & retrieval: scikit-learn, BERT/embeddings, FAISS, LangChain, OpenAI, LLaMA2  
- Cloud & infrastructure: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS), Docker, containerized pipelines  
- Tools: Streamlit / Gradio, GitHub Actions, pytest, observability & logging

---

## Selected projects (high-impact / production)
- **LLM Extraction Pipelines (Subsea7)** — Built and productionized LLaMA2/OpenAI + LangChain pipelines to extract metadata from PDFs/Docs/APIs; improved extraction accuracy and throughput for engineering documentation.  
- **MLOps: Anomaly & Risk Prediction (Subsea7)** — Designed pipelines and deployed models for anomaly detection and project risk prediction used by engineering teams.  
- **AI Content Platform Backend (MaqsoodLabs)** — Engineered Django backend and async pipelines to scrape & process 10k+ multilingual news articles/month; deployed on AWS with DB performance tuning.  
- **RAG Financial Chatbot (Freelance)** — LangChain + OpenAI embeddings + FAISS for production research retrieval.  
- **Resume Ranking WebApp (Freelance)** — Django + NLP (TF-IDF, Doc2Vec, BERT) for automated candidate matching.  
- **Predictive Production Scheduling (ALMAX / DANA)** — Forecasting models and dashboards to reduce delays and improve scheduling accuracy.

## How I work
- Prefer small, testable iterations; automation (CI/CD + infra as code) from day one.  
- Focus on reproducibility: containerized services, DB migration/versioning, logs & health checks.
